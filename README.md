# java-basics

This repository contains simple Java programs for learning and practicing core Java concepts.

## What's Included
- `BasicFib.java`: A basic program that calculates the Fibonacci sequence.
- `BasicFibwithMethod.java`: An improved version of the Fibonacci program that uses a separate method to generate the sequence.
- `OutlierDetection.java`: Finds the index of the first outlier in an arithmetic sequence.
- `anagramMethod.java`: Checks if two input words are anagrams of each other.
- `method101.java`: Shows basic method usage with simple examples.
- `methods102.java`: Demonstrates defining a method (`add`), sorting arrays of integers, and sorting the characters of a string.
- `MethodsDemo.java`: Demonstrates how to define and use methods in Java. *(if still included)*
- `SimpleCalc.java`: A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations. *(if still included)*
- `Calculator.java`: Demo calculator program that gets input using classes, methods, and Scanner.
- `CalculatorConst.java`: Calculator example using constructors, fields, and methods.
- `Constructor101.java`: Demonstrates using constructors to initialize objects and access their properties.
- `Cop.java`: Demonstrates using multiple classes and access modifiers (`protected`).
- `GroceryList.java`: Example program using constructors, methods, and inheritance.
- More beginner-friendly Java examples coming soon.
